            Four consumer tiers: At the top of the pyramid are 75-100 million affluent consumers. These are cosmopolitan groups composed of middle- and upper-income people in developed countries,
            and rich elites from the developing world (they are tier one). At the middle of the pyramid, in tiers two and three, are poor customers in developed nations and the rising middle classes
             in developing countries—they have been and are the target market for MNCs for whom strategies are made. At the bottom of the pyramid,
             tier four consists of 4 billion people earning $2 or less per day.    </p>
